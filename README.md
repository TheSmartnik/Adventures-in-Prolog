This repo contains a source code from a wonderful book [Adventure in Prolog](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XTZC8X1/).
While the book is almost 30 years old, it's a wonderful and exciting read. A really good intro into Prolog. After finishing it, I can't say I that I know Prolog, but know I feel a bit more confident with it.
